<blockquote>
<p>are you actually a publication focusing on Asian-American issues if you haven’t covered it at least once?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>White heroes are indeed romanticized in diaspora literature. But the author argues this is a natural result of colonization:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But at the same time, the reality that white-worshipping is a near-default side effect of colonization dulls the luster of the WMAF conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that critique against WMAF couples stems from misogyny: from the woman being able to live to “good life”, as compared to the Asian male who is unable.</p>
<p>Further, the author argues that Asian women typically have little independence in such interracial relationships, similar to Warbrides of past.</p>
