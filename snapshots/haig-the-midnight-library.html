<blockquote>
<p>The trouble was that eventually Nora began to lose any sense of who she was. Like a whispered word passed around from ear to ear, even her name began to sound like just a noise, signifying nothing.</p>
<p>‘It’s not working,’ she told Hugo, in her last proper conversation with him, in that beach bar in Corsica. ‘It’s not fun any more. I am not you. I need somewhere to stay. But the ground is never stable.’</p>
<p>‘The fun is in the jumping, mon amie.’</p>
<p>‘But what if it’s in the landing?’</p>
<p>And that was the moment he had returned to his purgatorial video store.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry,’ his other self said, as he sipped his wine and the sun set behind him, ‘I’ve forgotten who you are.’</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry,’ she said. ‘So have I.’</p>
<p>As she too faded away like the sun that had just been swallowed by the horizon.</p>
