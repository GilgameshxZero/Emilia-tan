<p>Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. His twinkling eyes peered out at Minerva. “So, my dear, how did you find Harry?”</p>
<p>Minerva opened her mouth. Then she closed her mouth. Then she opened her mouth again. No words came out.</p>

My parents raised me to believe that my name was Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, and many people here have told me that I look like my parents, I mean my other parents, but,” Harry frowned, realising, “for all I know, there could easily be spells to polymorph a child into a specified appearance -“</p>
<p>“Er, what, mate?”</p>
<p>Not headed for Ravenclaw, I take it. “Yes, I’m Harry Potter.”</p>
