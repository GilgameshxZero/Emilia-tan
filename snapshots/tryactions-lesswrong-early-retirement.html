<p>Can compute expected retirement from:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much you're saving per year</li>
<li>How much you're spending per year</li>
<li>How much money you currently have invested</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this assumes a policy of binary retirement, which is obviously not the best policy unless a critical event occurs at retirement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save an emergency fund of 1-2 months of expenses in a savings account.</li>
<li>Contribute to your employer's 401(k), but only up to the matching amount.  E.g. if they match half up to 6% of your salary, then contribute 6% of your salary.  Use contributions to buy your choice of index funds.  Default to just buying VFIFX if available.</li>
<li>Pay off high payday loans/credit cards/other crazy debt.</li>
<li>Increase your emergency fund to 6-12 months of expenses.</li>
<li>Pay off other debt (unless its interest rate is ~3% or less).</li>
<li>Put aside any money for large expected purchases (school, car, etc) in a savings account.</li>
<li>Max out your HSA if you have one.  Buy your choice of index funds if it has that option.  Default to just buying VFIFX if available.</li>
<li>If your income is low enough to be allowed to contribute, max out your traditional or Roth IRA.  Pick traditional if you're high tax-bracket, Roth if you're low tax-bracket.  Open one on <a href="http://Vanguard.com">Vanguard.com</a> if you don't have one.  Use it to buy your choice of index funds.  Default to just buying VFIFX.</li>
<li>Finish maxing out your 401(k).</li>
<li>Open a taxable brokerage account on Vanguard.  Dump the rest of your investment money in here.  Buy your choice of index funds.  Default to just buying VFIFX.</li>
<li>Never look at stock market indicators and ignore all stock news.  In principle, look at your total portfolio value every 6 months or so to check whether you have enough to retire.  Never click the sell button.</li>
<li>Retire once you have enough.<br>
Start converting some traditional funds to Roth if you'll need the money 5 years from now or have space in lower tax brackets due to low income.
<ul>
<li>Sell and withdraw as needed, starting with your taxable accounts.</li>
<li>Keep your expenses the same modulo inflation.</li>
<li>Do whatever you want!  Keep some level of professional activity / money-making to further reduce your risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
