<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this all started to change after the U.S. put a man on the moon. While this was certainly a &quot;giant leap for mankind,&quot; we lacked an understanding of what our next step would be. Without a new North Star to guide us, we stopped moving forward and our vision for the future began to fade. This all came to a head when the U.S. hosted its last Fair in 1984. Tired and dated, it ended in bankruptcy â€” symbolically extinguishing our hope for a collective vision of the future.</p>
